# Movie Criteria App
 
- Hello, Jakob Lehrskov Joensen made this, all on his own.
 I sadly didn't have time to make any UML diagrams or scrum plans for myself yet. I've been ill, so most of the energy I could gather I focused on making a somewhat functional app.
 As for the improvements I want to make, there are many. I want to make it so the criteria code doen't have to convert the objects back and forth from object to string as it does right now. I want to make it feature complete and figure out how to program a UI in Unity that doesn't look so default. And I wish to draw more on the API (and possibly more databases) and use it to add more detail about the different choices the people make while using the app.
 The general idea is that this is supposed to be an app people use together in order to choose a film to watch on a streaming service, instead of endlessly scrolling through options on however many different pages and screens they may have. To do this, they choose the criteria that are important to them and allow the app to help them choose from those wishes.
 The build is called First Build and is located in the main folder, all the rest is standard.
